- Empty class [one byte to make them distinguishable.]
class Thing {
public:
    Thing();                        // default constructor
    Thing(const Thing&);            // copy c'tor
    Thing& operator=(const Thing&); // copy-assign
    ~Thing();                       // d'tor
    // C++11:
    Thing(Thing&&);                 // move c'tor
    Thing& operator=(Thing&&);      // move-assign

If i allocate using malloc can we delocate using delete
- Class vs Structure
- New vs Malloc
- Null vs void ptr
- Reference vs Pointer [ No reference in C]
- OOPS Concepts
- Abstraction vs Encapsulation

- Friend Class and Function
- Constructor and types
Why pass by refernce in copy and pass by value, what happens if we pass by value
- Purpose of scope resolution operator
- Destructor
- templates
- dangling pointer and how to avoid
- Difference between delete and delete[]
- There are 3 classes a, b and C, B from A and C from B, how to access private of A in C?
- Memory storage of all variables
- Copy Constructor - with string

Both are compile time or runtime

- C++ 11 standards

- C++ compiler version
- Design patterns
- Class A has 2 functions F1 and F2, F2 is virtual and inside F1 func body we are calling F2. We have created base class pointer which is pointing
to derived class B, we are overiding F2
- Smart pointers and types
