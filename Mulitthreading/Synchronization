Synchronization primitives are low-level building blocks provided by programming languages or operating systems to help implement synchronization. 
They are the fundamental mechanisms used to manage access to shared resources.

Types of Synchronization Primitives

Locks/Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion)
Prevents multiple threads from entering a critical section simultaneously.
Example: std::mutex in C++, pthread_mutex in POSIX.

Semaphores
Generalized locking mechanism allowing a limited number of threads to access a resource simultaneously.
Example: std::counting_semaphore in C++20, sem_t in POSIX.

Spinlocks
A lock where a thread continuously checks for the lock to be released (busy-waiting).
Useful when the wait time is short.

Condition Variables
Used to block a thread until a particular condition is met.
Works with a mutex for signaling.
Example: std::condition_variable in C++.

Read-Write Locks
Allow multiple readers or one writer at a time.
Example: pthread_rwlock in POSIX.

Atomic Variables
Guarantee atomic operations on shared variables without the need for explicit locks.
Example: std::atomic in C++.

Futures and Promises
Used for synchronizing results between threads.
Example: std::future and std::promise in C++.

Synchronization Problems
Without proper synchronization, concurrency issues arise:

Race Conditions
Occurs when multiple threads/processes access shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results.

Deadlocks
Two or more threads wait indefinitely for resources locked by each other.

Starvation
A thread waits indefinitely to acquire a resource because other higher-priority threads are continuously served.

Livelocks
Threads keep responding to each otherâ€™s changes without making progress.
