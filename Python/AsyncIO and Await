AsyncIO and Await

Coroutine Object: 
  A coroutine object is what you get when you call an async def function.
  It represents the future execution of that function.
  To make it actually run, you must either await it or schedule it in an event loop (asyncio.run)

async without await

  import asyncio
  async def say_hello():
      print("Hello, world!")
  # Call the coroutine
  result = say_hello()
  print(result)

  O/P
  <coroutine object say_hello at 0x...>

  say_hello() is defined as async, so calling it does not run the function immediately.
  Instead, it returns a coroutine object.

Three ways to call async function
  1. Using await inside another coroutine
       async def main():
         result = await fetch_data()
         print(result)
       asyncio.run(main())

  2. Using asyncio.run() at the top level
       asyncio.run(fetch_data())

  3. Scheduling with asyncio.create_task() or loop.create_task()
      async def main():
        task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())
        result = await task
        print(result)
      asyncio.run(main())

Note:
  async:
    Calling them directly just gives you a coroutine object
    To actually execute them, you need await, asyncio.run, or task scheduling
