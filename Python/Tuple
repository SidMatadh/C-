Tuple 

Immutable → once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.
Ordered → elements maintain their position.
Can contain mixed types (ints, strings, lists, etc.).
Hashable → can be used as dictionary keys if all elements inside are hashable.
Faster than lists for iteration and storage (because they’re immutable).
